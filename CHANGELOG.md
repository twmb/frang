v1.10.1
===

This patch release contains minor kgo internal improvements, and enables a new
API for kadm. This patch contains no bug fixes. This patch should help recover
faster if a transaction coordinator goes down while producing.

This is released in tandem with kadm v1.6.0, which contains a small kadm bugfix
for `DeleteRecords`, `OffsetForLeaderEpoch`, and `DescribeProducers`, and
(hopefully) finishes support for all current admin APIs.

v1.10.0
===

This is a small release that contains one bug fix, one new feature, and
improvements in log lines, and improvements to work around AWS MSK being a bit
odd with SASL reauthentication.

Previously, the client's sticky partitioners actually did not preserve
stickiness because the client did not attach previous-partitions when rejoining
the group. That is now fixed.

The new feature, `ConsumePreferringLagFn`, allows you to have some advanced
reordering of how to consume. The recommended way of using this option is
`kgo.ConsumePreferringLagFn(kgo.PreferLagAt(50))`, which allows you to favor
laggy partitions if the client is more than 50 records behind in the topic.

The kadm module is also released with v1.4.0, which contains new APIs to find
coordinators for groups or transactional IDs, and an API to fetch API versions
for all brokers in the cluster.

v1.9.1
===

This is a small patch release to work around two behavior problems, one with
AWS and one with Redpanda. This is not an important bug release if you are
using this library against Kafka itself.

For AWS, AWS is unexpectedly expiring certain permissions before the SASL
lifetime is up. This manifests as `GROUP_AUTHORIZATION_ERROR` while consuming.
Previously, we the client would mark connections to reauthenticate when the
connection was within 3s of SASL expiry. We now are more pessimistic and
reauthenticate within 95% to 98% of the lifetime, with a 2s minimum. This is
similar to the Java client, which has always used 85 to 95% of the SASL
lifetime and has no minimum.

For Redpanda, Redpanda's transaction support is nearly complete (v22.3 release
imminent), but Redpanda can return `UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR` a bit more than Kafka
does. These errors are being ironed out, but there is no harm in the client to
pre-emptively handling these as retryable.

- [`eb6e3b5`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/eb6e3b5) kgo sasl reauth: be more pessimistic

v1.9.0
===

This release contains one important bugfix (sequence number int32 overflow) for
long-lived producers, one minor bugfix that allows this client to work on 32
bit systems, and a few other small improvements.

This project now has integration tests ran on every PR (and it is now forbidden
to push directly to master). These integration tests run against Kraft (Kafka +
Raft), which itself seems to not be 100% polished. A good amount of
investigation went into hardening the client internals to not fail when Kraft
is going sideways.

This release also improves behavior when a consumer group leader using an
instance ID restarts _and_ changes the topics it wants to consume from. See the
KIP-814 commit for more details.

It is now easier to setup a TLS dialer with a custom dial timeout, it is easier
to detect if requests are failing due to missing SASL, and it is now possible
to print attributes with `RecordFormatter`.

Lastly, the corresponding kadm v1.3.0 release adds new LeaveGroup admin APIs.

v1.8.0
===

This feature release adds one new API in kgo, one new field on `kgo.Record`,
and stabilizes `kversion.V3_3_0()`. There is also one minor bug fix:
`Record.TimestampType()` previously did not correctly return 1 to indicate
broker generated timestamp types.

This release improves the behavior of the client if the entire cluster becomes
unreachable. Previously, the client may not have been able to reload metadata
to discover new endpoints; now, the client periodically tries a seed broker to
issue randomly-routable requests to. This release also makes a few more
internal errors retryable, which can help reduce some request failures.

A few docs have been improved. Notably, the UniformBytesPartitioner contains a
new line describing that it may have poor interaction with lingering. See the
doc comment for more details as well as the linked Kafka issue. This library
does not use lingering by default.

v1.7.1
===

This release fixes two bugs, one that is obscure and unlikely to be ran into in
most use cases, and one that is not as obsure and may be ran into in a racy
scenario. It is recommended to upgrade.

[`3191842`][171a] fixes a bug that could eventually lead to a completely
stalled consumer. The problem can happen whenever an internal "consumer
session" is stopped and restarted -- which happens on most rebalances, and
happens whenever a partition moves from one broker to another. This logic race
required no active fetches to be in flight nor buffered, and required a fetch
to _just about_ be issued.

[`0ca6478`][171b] fixes a complicated bug that could result in a panic. It
requires the following:

* using a single client to produce and consume to the
* consuming from that topic first
* producing to that topic after the first consume
* the metadata load that is triggered from the produce fails with partition errors
* the metadata load retry moves a previously-errored partition from one broker to another

Any deviation from this sequence of events would not result in a panic. If the
final step did not move the partition between brokers, the client would still
be internally problematic, but there would be no visible problem (the partition
would be produced to two brokers, the produce to the wrong broker would fail
while the correct broker would succeed),

v1.7.0
===

This feature release adds a few new APIs to expose more information in the
client or make some things simpler. There are also two minor bug fixes:
manually committing a topic with no partitions would previously result in an
error, and we previously did not properly load the partition leader epochs for
a brief period of time when the client started which prevented truncation
detection. See the commits below for more details.

v1.6.0
===

This release contains two new APIs, a minor bugfix, and other notable
improvements and stabilizations.

The [kadm][160kadmdoc] package is now stabilized as a separate,
[v1.0 module][160kadmtag]. This module will remain separate from the top level
franz-go so that it can have independent minor releases, and has more freedom
to have major version bumps if necessary. I took stabilization as an
opportunity to break & fix some infrequently used APIs; this can be seen in the
commit linked below.

I have also created a new package for the schema registry, [sr][160srdoc]. This
will likely live as a separate module for similar reasons to kmsg and kadm: to
have more freedom to make major-version-changing breaking changes if Confluent
decides to change some of their HTTP API. I expect to stabilize sr once I know
of at least one use case that helps double check the API is alright.

## Bugfix

Previously, if you consumed a topic that had record timestamps generated by the
broker per `LogAppendTime`, this client would not set the timestamp properly
when consumed. We now set the timestamp properly.

## Improvements

The client now allows the user to set a timestamp when producing: if a record's
timestamp is non-zero, the client will not override it.

The default partitioner has been changed to the new `UniformBytesPartitioner`.
This is an improvement on the previous `StickyKeyPartitioner` in a few ways and
can be read about in [KIP-794][KIP-794]. The implementation in this client is
slightly different from KIP-794 in ways that are documented on the
`UniformBytesPartitioner` itself. This new partitioner can result in more
balanced load over a long period of producing to your brokers. Note: the new
default partitioner partitions keys the _same_ as the old default partitioner,
so this is not a behavior change.

## Features

* `UniformBytesPartitioner` exists, which can be used for more balanced
  producing over long time periods. The default batch size switch is 64KiB, and
you may want to tune this up or down if you produce in high or low throughput.

* `kversion.V3_2_0()` now officially exists, and kversion correctly detects
  v3.2 brokers.

* kmsg has a new `UnsafeReadFrom` interface to help reduce garbage in some
  advanced scenarios (requires kmsg@v1.1.0).

v1.5.3
===

This bugfix release fixes a problem I noticed when reading Kafka source code
last week. KIP-98 never specified what a sequence number wrapping meant when
producing with idempotency enabled / with transactions, so I implemented this
to wrap to negative. As it turns out, there is validation in the Kafka code
that the sequence number must wrap to 0.

Thus, using this client, if an application produced `2**31` records to a single
partition with idempotent production or with transactions without restarting,
this client would enter a fatal state.

I'm not sure how common this use case is considering this bug has not been
reported in 2 years, but this patch release is to ensure people do not
encounter this bug after this point.

I've tested this by producing >2.147bil records to a single-partition Kafka topic
before this patch, which eventually results in `INVALID_RECORD` errors, and
then producing >2.2 records to a single-partition Kafka topic after this
patch. The patch allows the client to produce indefinitely.

This release also includes a few commits that eliminate two external
dependencies, and contains a patch in kadm to avoid a panic on nil input to a
function.

v1.5.2
===

This tiny release contains another fix for `RecordReader`, specifically for
regex parsing, and changes the behavior of `MarkCommitRecords` to its original
behavior.

* For `RecordReader`, the regex type was not properly registered everywhere
  internally. This resulted in `%v{re#...#}\n` trying to parse a newline as
part of the regex, rather than as a delimiter. This is fixed and a test case
added. Note that this feature is niche _and_ new, so this is a very minor bug.

* For `MarkCommitRecords`, v1.3.3 changed the behavior to allow rewinds. This
  is difficult to reason about and can result in bugs. More likely, you just
want to periodically mark to move forward; the behavior now is more in line
with what people expect.

- [`41284b3`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/41284b3) RecordReader: fix regex reading even more

v1.5.1
===

This release fixes a minor bug in `RecordReader`, and has a behavior change for
polling records (and a corresponding tiny new helper API for this).

For the bugfix, `RecordReader` did not always properly return
`io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`. We now return it more properly and add tests for the
missing edge cases.

For the behavior change, we now inject an error into `PollFetches` and
`PollRecords` if the user context is canceled. Previously, we would just quit
the poll and return. This change introduces a new corresponding function,
`Fetches.Err() error`. The thought here is that now we have more injected
errors, so `Fetches.Err` can make it easier to check various errors.

v1.5.0
===

This release adds a few new APIs, has a few small behavior changes, and has one
"breaking" change.

## Breaking changes

The `kerberos` package is now a dedicated separate module. Rather than
requiring a major version bump, since this fix is entirely at the module level
for an almost entirely unused package, I figured it is _okayish_ to technically
break compatibility for the few usages of this package, when the fix can be
done entirely when `go get`ing.

The [gokrb5](https://github.com/jcmturner/gokrb5) library, basically the only
library in the Go ecosystem that implements Kerberos, has a slightly [broken
license](https://github.com/jcmturner/gokrb5/issues/461). Organizations that
are sensitive to this were required to not use franz-go even if they did not
use Kerberos because franz-go pulls in a dependency on gokrb5.

Now, with `kerberos` being a distinct and separate module, depending on
franz-go only will _not_ cause an indirect dependency on gokrb5.

If your upgrade is broken by this change, run:

```go
go get github.com/twmb/franz-go/pkg/sasl/kerberos@v1.0.0
go get github.com/twmb/franz-go@v1.5.0
```

## Behavior changes

* `UnknownTopicRetries` now allows -1 to signal disabling the option (meaning
  unlimited retries, rather than no retries). This follows the convention of
other options where -1 disables limits.

## Improvements

* Waiting for unknown topics while producing now takes into account both the
  produce context and aborting. Previously, the record context was only taken
into account _after_ a topic was loaded. The same is true for aborting buffered
records: previously, abort would hang until a topic was loaded.

* New APIs are added to kmsg to deprecate the previous `Into` functions. The
  `Into` functions still exist and will not be removed until kadm is stabilized
(see [#141](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/issues/141)).

## Features

* `ConsumeResetOffset` is now clearer, you can now use `NoResetOffset` with
  start _or_ end _or_ exact offsets, and there is now the very useful
`Offset.AfterMilli` function. Previously, `NoResetOffset` only allowed starting
consuming at the start and it was not obvious why. We keep the previous
default-to-start behavior, but we now allow modifying it. As well, `AfterMilli`
can be used to largely replace `AtEnd`. Odds are, you want to consume all
records after your program starts _even if_ new partitions are added to a
topic. Previously, if you added a partition to a topic, `AtEnd` would miss
records that were produced until the client refreshed metadata and discovered
the partition. Because of this, you were safer using `AtStart`, but this
unnecessarily forced you to consume everything on program start.

* Custom group balancers can now return errors, you can now intercept commits
  to attach metadata, and you can now intercept offset fetches to read
metadata.  Previously, none of this was possible. I considered metadata a bit
of a niche feature, but accessing it (as well as returning errors when
balancing) is required if you want to implement streams. New APIs now exist to
support the more advanced behavior: `PreCommitFnContext`, `OnOffsetsFetched`,
and `GroupMemberBalancerOrError`. As well, `BalancePlan.AsMemberIDMap` now
exists to provide access to a plan's underlying plan map. This did not exist
previously because I wanted to keep the type opaque for potential future
changes, but the odds of this are low and we can attempt forward compatibility
when the time arises.

* `RecordReader` now supports regular expressions for text values.

v1.4.2
===

This release fixes a potential incremental fetch session spin loop /
undesirable behavior. This was not reported, but can happen if you use many
clients against your cluster.

Previously, if a broker advertised that it supported consumer fetch sessions
but did not actually create any and returned "0" to signify no session was
created, the client would accept that 0 as a new fetch session. If the fetch
response returned no data and thus made no forward progress, the next fetch
request would include no partitions (believing a fetch session was created),
and the broker would again reply immediately with no data and no fetch session.
This would loop. Now, if the broker indicates no fetch session was created, we
immediately stop trying to create new fetch sessions and never try again.

In practice, fetch sessions are rejected if and replied to with 0 if a new one
cannot be created. The default fetch session cache in Kafka is 1,000. If you
have more than 1,000 active clients (where brokers count as clients against
other brokers), you are at risk of this bug.

This bug would manifest in clearly visible ways: higher cpu, no forward
progress while consuming. If you have not seen these, you have not experienced
the bug. However, it is recommended that all users upgrade to avoid it.

This has two followup fixes to [`83b0a32`][83b0a32], one which fixes behavior
that broke `EndBeginTxnSafe`, and one which mirrors some of the logic
supporting `EndBeginTxnUnsafe` into `EndTransaction` itself. This also fixes a
very rare data race that _realistically_ would result in a new connection being
killed immediately (since at the CPU, reads/writes of pointers is atomic).

v1.4.1
===

This release pins kmsg to its newly stable version v1.0.0, fixing a compilation
issue for anybody doing `go get -u`.

The kmsg package was previously unversioned because Kafka sometimes changes the
protocol in such a way that breaks the API as chosen in kmsg (plain types, not
objects for everything). The most recent change in kmsg to match a recent type
rename in Kafka broke kgo because kgo depended on the old name. Again, this was
not pinned because franz-go did not depend on a specific version of kmsg. To
prevent this issue from happening again, we now pin to a stable kmsg version.

There are also two small bugfixes and a few improvements. Previously,
`ProducerFenced` was marked as retriable, which could result in the client
internally entering a fatal state that the user was unaware of. This should now
be bubbled up. As well, there were a few subtle issues with `EndBeginTxnUnsafe`
that have been addressed.

v1.4.0
===

This release adds a lot of new features and changes a few internal behaviors.
The new features have been tested, but it is possible that a bug slipped by—if
you see one, please open an issue and the bug can be fixed promptly.

## Behavior changes

* **Promises are now serialized**. Previously, promises were called at the end
  of handling produce requests. As well, errors that caused records to fail
independent of producing could fail whenever. Now, all promises are called in
one loop. Benchmarking showed that concurrent promises did not really help,
even in cases where the promises could be concurrent. As well, my guess is that
most people serialize promises, resulting in more complicated logic punted to
the users. Now with serializing promises, user code can be simpler.

* The default `MetadataMinAge` has been lowered from 5s to 2.5s. Metadata
refreshes internally on retryable errors, 2.5s helps fail records for
non-existing topics quicker. Related, for sharded requests, we now cache topic
& partition metadata for the `MetadataMinAge`. This mostly benefits
`ListOffsets`, where usually a person may list both the start and end back to
back. We cannot cache indefinitely because a user may add partitions outside
this client, but 2.5s is still helpful especially for how infrequently sharded
requests are issued.

* Group leaders now track topics that the leader is not interested in
  consuming. Previously, if leader A consumed only topic foo and member B only
bar, then leader A would not notice if partitions were added to bar. Now, the
leader tracks bar. This behavior change only affects groups where the members
consume non-overlapping topics.

* Group joins & leaves now include a reason, as per KIP-800. This will be
  useful when Kafka 3.2 is released.

* Transactions no longer log `CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS` errors at the info
  level. This was a noisy log that meant nothing and was non-actionable. We
still track this at the debug level.

## Features

A few new APIs and options have been added. These will be described shortly
here, and the commits are linked below.

* `ConcurrentTransactionsBackoff`: a new option that allows configuring the
  backoff when starting a transaction runs into the `CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS`
error. Changing the backoff can decrease latency if Kafka is fast, but can
increase load on the cluster.

* `MaxProduceRequestsInflightPerBroker`: a new option that allows changing the
  max inflight produce requests per broker _if_ you disable idempotency.
Idempotency has an upper bound of 5 requests; by default, disabling idempotency
sets the max inflight to 1.

* `UnknownTopicRetries`: a new option that sets how many times a metadata load
  for a topic can return `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION` before all records
buffered for the topic are failed. As well, we now use this option more widely:
if a topic is loaded successfully and then later repeatedly experiences these
errors, records will be failed. Previously, this limit was internal and was
only applied before the topic was loaded successfully once.

* `NoResetOffset`: a new special offset that can be used with
  `ConsumeResetOffset` to trigger the client to enter a fatal state if
`OffsetOutOfRange` is encountered.

* `Client.PurgeTopicsFromClient`: a new API that allows for completely removing
a topic from the client. This can help if you regex consume and delete a topic,
or if you produce to random topics and then stop producing to some of them.

* `Client.AddConsumeTopics`: a new API that enables you to consume from topics
  that you did not initially configure. This enables you to add more topics to
consume from without restarting the client; this works both both direct
consumers and group consumers.

* `Client.TryProduce`: a new API that is a truly non-blocking produce. If the
  client has the maximum amount of records buffered, this function will
immediately fail a new promise with `ErrMaxBuffered`.

* `Client.ForceMetadataRefresh`: a new API that allows you to manually trigger
a metadata refresh. This can be useful if you added partitions to a topic and
want to trigger a metadata refresh to load those partitions sooner than the
default `MetadataMaxAge` refresh interval.

* `Client.EndAndBeginTransaction`: a new API that can be used to have higher
  throughput when producing transactionally. This API requires care; if you use
it, read the documentation for what it provides and any downsides.

* `BlockRebalancesOnPoll` and `Client.AllowRebalance`: a new option and
  corresponding required API that allows for easier reasoning about when
rebalances can happen. This option can be greatly beneficial to users for
simplifying code, but has a risk around taking so long that your group member
is booted from the group. Two examples were added using these options.

* `kversion.V3_1_0`: the kversion package now officially detects v3.1 and has
  an API for it.

v1.3.5
===

This patch release fixes a panic in `GroupTransactSession.End` and has three
behavior changes that are beneficial to users. The panic was introduced in
v1.3.0; if using a `GroupTransactSession`, it is recommended you upgrade to
this release.

The next release aims to be v1.4.0, this release is a small one to address a
few issues before the much larger and feature filled v1.4 release.

v1.3.4
===

This small patch release fixes a problem with
[`4f2e7fe3`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/4f2e7fe3) which was meant
to address [#98](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/issues/98). The fix was not
complete in that the fix would only trigger if a group member had partitions
added to it. We now rearrange the logic such that it occurs always. This bug
was found while making a change in the code in support of a new feature in the
v1.4 branch; this bug was not encountered in production.

This also bumps the franz-go/pkg/kmsg dependency so that `JoinGroup.Reason` is
properly tagged as v9+.

The next release will be v1.4, which is nearly ready to be merged into this
branch and tagged. Follow issue #135 for more details.

v1.3.3
===

This patch release contains two minor bug fixes and a few small behavior
changes. The upcoming v1.4 release will contain more changes to lint the entire
codebase and will have a few new options as features to configure the client
internals. There are a few features in development yet that I would like to
complete before tagging the next minor release.

## Bug fixes

Repeated integration testing resulted in a rare data race, and one other bug
was found by linting. For the race, if a group was left _or_ heartbeating
stopped _before_ offset fetching finished, then there would be a concurrent
double write to an error variable: one write would try to write an error from
the request being cut (which would be `context.Canceled`), and the other write
would write the same error, but directly from `ctx.Err`. Since both of these
are the same type pointer and data pointer, it is unlikely this race would
result in anything if it was ever encountered, and encountering it would be
rare.

For the second bug, after this prior one, I wondered if any linter would have
caught this bug (the answer is no). However, in the process of heavily linting
the code base, a separate bug was found. This bug has **no impact**, but it is
good to fix. If you previously consumed and specified _exact_ offsets to
consume from, the internal `ListOffsets` request would use that offset as a
timestamp, rather than using -1 as I meant to internally. The whole point is
just to load the partition, so using a random number for a timestmap is just as
good as using -1, but we may as well use -1 to be proper.

## Behavior changes

Previously when producing, the buffer draining goroutine would sleep for 50ms
whenever it started. This was done to give high throughput producers a chance
to produce more records within the first batch, rather than the loop being so
fast that one record is in the first batch (and more in the others). This 50ms
sleep is a huge penalty to oneshot producers (producing one message at a time,
synchronously) and also was a slight penalty to high throughput producers
whenever the drain loop quit and needed to be resumed. We now eliminate this
sleep. This may result in more smaller batches, but definitely helps oneshot
producers. A linger can be used to avoid small batches, if needed.

Previously, due to MS Azure improperly replying to produce requests when acks
were zero, a discard goroutine was added to drain the produce connection if the
client was configured to produce with no acks. Logic has been added to quit
this goroutine if nothing is read on that goroutine for 3x the connection
timeout overhead, which is well enough time that a response should be received
if the broker is ever going to send one.

Previously, `MarkCommitRecords` would forbid rewinds and only allow advancing
offsets. The code now allows rewinds if you mark an early offset after you have
already marked a later offset. This brings the behavior in line with the
current `CommitOffsets`.

Previously, if the client encountered `CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS` during transactions,
it would sleep for 100ms and then retry the relevant request. This sleep has been
dropped to 20ms, which should help latency when transacting quickly. The v1.4
release will allow this number to be configured with a new option.

## Additions

KIP-784 and KIP-814 are now supported (unreleased yet in Kafka). Support for
KIP-814 required bumping the franz-go's kmsg dep. Internally, only KIP-814
affects client behavior, but since this is unrelased, it is not changing any
behavior.

v1.3.2
===

This patch fixes a bug of unclear severity related to transactions. Credit goes
to [@eduard-netsajev](https://github.com/eduard-netsajev) for finding this long
standing problem.

In Kafka, if you try to start a transaction too soon after finishing the
previous one, Kafka may not actually have internally finished the prior
transaction yet and can return a `CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS` error. To work
around this, clients are expected to retry when they see this error (even
though it is marked as not retriable).

This client does that properly, but unfortunately did not bubble up any _non_
`CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS` errors.

From the code, it _appears_ as if in the worst case, this could have meant that
transactions invisibly looked like they were working and being used when they
actually were not. However, it's likely that other errors would be noticed
internally, and it's possible that if you encountered problems, the entire ETL
pipeline would stall anyway.

All told, it's not entirely clear what the ramifications for this bug are, and
it is recommended that if you use transactions, you should update immediately.

- [PR #131](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/pull/131) - txns: don't ignore error in doWithConcurrentTransactions

v1.3.1
===

This small patch release fixes a leaked-goroutine problem after closing a
consuming client, and adds one config validation to hopefully reduce confusion.

For the bug, if a fetch was buffered when you were closing the client, an
internal goroutine would stay alive. In normal cases where you have one client
in your program and you close it on program shutdown, this leak is not really
important. If your program recreates consuming clients often and stays alive,
the leaked goroutine could eventually result in unexpected memory consumption.
Now, the client internally unbuffers all fetches at the end of `Close`, which
allows the previously-leaking goroutine to exit.

For the config validation, using `ConsumePartitions` and `ConsumeTopics` with
the same topic in both options would silently ignore the topic in
`ConsumePartitions`. Now, the client will return an error that using the same
topic in both options is invalid.

- [`bb581f4`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/bb581f4) **bugfix** client: unbuffer fetches on Close to allow mangeFetchConcurrency to quit

v1.3.0
===

This release contains three new features, a few behavior changes, and one minor
bugfix.

For features, you can now adjust fetched offsets before they are used (thanks
@michaelwilner!), you can now "ping" your cluster to see if the client can
connect at all, and you can now use `SetOffsets` when consuming partitions
manually. As a somewhat of a feature-ish, producing no longer requires a
context, instead if a context is nil, `context.Background` is used (this was
added to allow more laziness when writing small unimportant files).

The transactional behavior change is important: the documentation changes are
worth reading, and it is worth using a 2.5+ cluster along with the
`RequireStableFetchOffsets` option if possible. The metadata leader epoch
rewinding behavior change allows the client to continue in the event of odd
cluster issues.

In kadm, we now return individual per-partition errors if partitions are not
included in OffsetCommit responses. The generated code now has a few more enums
(thanks [@weeco](https://github.com/weeco)!)

Lastly, as a small bugfix, `client.Close()` did not properly stop seed brokers.
A previous commit split seed brokers and non-seed brokers internally into two
fields but did not add broker shutdown on the now-split seed broker field.

v1.2.6
===

This patch release contains a behavior change to immediate metadata triggers to
better support some loading error conditions and drops the default
MetadataMinAge from 10s to 5s. For more details, see commit
[`8325ba7`][8325ba7] or issue [114][issue114].

This release also contains a bugfix for using preferred read replicas.
Previously, if a replica was not the leader of any partition being consumed,
the client would not internally save knowledge of that replica and it could not
be consumed from. This would result in the client ping-ponging trying to fetch
from the leader and then erroring when the leader indicates the client should
consume from a replica the client does not know about. This is no longer the
case.

Lastly, this patch fixes the behavior of rotating through partitions while
consuming. Previously, the client rotated through partitions to evaluate for
consuming, but then saved those partitions to nested maps which had
non-deterministic (and, due to how Go ranges, mostly not-that-random) range
semantics. The client now always rotates through partitions and topics in the
order the partitions are evaluated. The old behavior could theoretically lead
to more starvation than necessary while consuming. The new behavior should have
no starvation, but really due to the randomness of the prior behavior, the new
semantics may be a wash. However, the new semantics are the original intended
semantics.

v1.2.5
===

This small patch release fixes one non-impacting bug in SCRAM authentication,
and allows more errors to be abort&retryable rather than fatal while
transactionally committing.

For SCRAM, this client did not implement the client-final-reply completely
correctly: this client replied with just the `client nonce`, not the `client
nonce + server nonce`. Technically this was not to spec, but no broker today
enforces this final nonce correctly. However, the client has been fixed so that
if someday brokers do start enforcing the nonce correctly, this client will be
ready.

For transactional committing, we can handle a few extra errors while committing
without entering a fatal state. Previously, `ILLEGAL_GENERATION` was handled:
this meant that a rebalance began and completed before the client's commit went
through. In this case, we just aborted the transaction and continued
successfully. We can do this same thing for `REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS`, which is
similar to the prior error, as well as for errors that result from client
request retry limits.

The integration tests now no longer depend on `kcl`, meaning you can simply `go
test` in the `kgo` package to test against your local brokers. Seeds can be
provided by specifying a `KGO_SEEDS` environment variable, otherwise the
default is 127.0.0.1:9092.

Lastly, a few bugs have been fixed in the not-yet-stable,
currently-separate-module kadm package. If you use that package, you may have
already pulled in these fixes.

- [`8f34083`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/8f34083) consumer group: avoid regex log if no topics were added/skipped

v1.2.4
===

This patch release fixes handling forgotten topics in fetch sessions, and
allows disabling fetch sessions. Previously, if a topic or partition was paused
with fetch sessions active, the partition would continually be fetched and
skipped behind the scenes. As well, the client now allows disabling fetch
sessions entirely if they are not desired.

This also fixes one bug in the `RecordReader`: using an empty layout would mean
that any `io.Reader` would result in infinite messages.

Lastly, some log messages have been improved.

- [`cfb4a7f`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/cfb4a7f) **bugfix** kgo: error if RecordReader layout is empty

v1.2.3
===

This patch fixes the client not supporting brokers that start from large node
IDs. The client previously assumed that brokers started at node ID 0 or 1 and
went upwards from there. Starting at node 1000 would not always work.

This also adds two very tiny new APIs, `FetchTopic.Each{Partition,Record}`,
which are so tiny they are not worth a minor release.

More work on kadm has been done: the package now supports ACLs.

SASL no longer has a hard coded 30s write timeout; instead, we use the
RequestTimeoutOverhead same as everything else. The default produce request
timeout has been dropped to 10s from 30s, which is still ~10x more time than
Kafka usually needs at the p99.9 level. This will help speed up producing to
hung brokers. As well, the default backoff has been changed to 250ms-2.5s
rather than 100ms-1s. The old backoff retried too quickly in all cases.

Logs for assigned partitions have been improved, as have logs for inner
metadata request / fetch request failures.

v1.2.2
===

This patch release fixes a bug with cooperative group consuming. If a
cooperative group member rebalances before offset fetching returns, then it
will not resume offset fetching partitions it kept across the rebalance. It
will only offset fetch new partitions.

This release fixes that by tracking a bit of fetch state across rebalances for
cooperative consumers. See the embedded comments in the commit for more
details.

- [`4f2e7fe`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/4f2e7fe) **bugfix** consumer group: fix cooperative rebalancing losing offset fetches


v1.2.1
===

This patch release fixes a panic that can occur in the following sequence of
events:

1) a LeaveGroup occurs (which always happens in Close)
2) the cluster moves a partition from one broker to another
3) a metadata refresh occurs and sees the partition has moved

Whenever a client closes, `Close` calls `LeaveGroup` (even if not in a group),
and there is a small window of time before the metadata loop quits.

- [`864526a`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/864526a) **bugfix** consuming: avoid setting cursors to nil on LeaveGroup


v1.2.0
===

This release contains new formatting features and sets the stage for a new
admin administration package to be added in v1.3.0. For now, the `kadm` package
is in a separate unversioned module. The API is relatively stable, but I'd like
to play with it some more to figure out what needs changing or not. Any
external experimenting and feedback is welcome.

There are two new types introduced in the kgo package: `RecordFormatter` and
`RecordReader`. Both of these extract and improve logic used in the
[`kcl`](github.com/twmb/kcl) repo. These are effectively powerful ways to
format records into bytes, and read bytes into records. They are not _exactly_
opposites of each other due to reasons mentioned in the docs. I expect
formatting to be more useful than reading, and formatting is actually
surprisingly fast if the formatter is reused. The one off `Record.AppendFormat`
builds a new formatter on each use and should only be used if needed
infrequently, because building the formatter is the slow part.

I am considering removing the default of snappy compression for the v1.3
release. I generally find it useful: many people forget to add compression
which increases network costs and makes broker disks fill faster, and snappy
compression is cheap cpu-wise and fast. However, some people are confused when
their bandwidth metrics look lower than they expect, and snappy _does_ mean
throughput is not _as_ high as it could be. Removal of snappy by default may or
may not happen, but if anybody agrees or disagrees with it, please mention so
in an issue or on discord.

There are a few minor behavior changes in this release that should make default
clients safer (lowering max buffered memory) and faster on request failures.
These behavior changes should not affect anything. As well, the `bench` utility
no longer uses snappy by default.

Non-formatter/reader/kadm commits worth mentioning:

v1.1.4
===

This includes on more patch for the prior tag to fully make `InitProducerID`
retriable when it encounters a retriable error.

- [`d623ffe`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/d623ffe) errors: make errProducerIDLoadFail retriable


v1.1.3
===

This patch allows `BrokerNotAvailable` to be retried. As well, it contains some
small improvements under the hood. When sharding certain requests, we now avoid
issuing requests to partitions that have no leader. We also better collapse
per-partition sharding error messages.

Dial errors are now not retriable. Now, if a produce request fails because the
broker cannot be dialed, we refresh metadata. Previously, we just accepted the
error as retriable and tried producing again.

The SoftwareVersion used in ApiVersions requests now includes your current kgo
version.

This tag is based on a 1.1.x branch in the repo. There is some feature work
that is yet to be stabilized on the main branch.

Notable commits:

- [`747ab0c`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/747ab0c) kerr: make BrokerNotAvailable retriable
- [`f494301`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/f494301) errors: make dial errors non-retriable
- [`4a76861`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/4a76861) config: default to kgo dep version in ApiVersions

v1.1.2
===

This patch release fixes processing the `LogAppendTime` timestamp for message
set v1 formatted records. Message set v1 records were used only during the
Kafka v0.10 releases.

v1.1.1
===

This patch release fixes a bug in `PollRecords` that could cause a panic during
cluster instability. This also defines Kafka 3.0 in kversion.

v1.1.0
===

This minor release contains a few useful features, an incredibly minor bugfix
(fixing an error message), and a behavior change around buffering produced
records for unknown topics. As well, all plugins have been tagged v1.0.0.

- [`cf04997`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/cf04997) errors: export ErrRecordRetries, ErrRecordTimeout

v1.0.0
===

This is a significant release and is a commitment to not changing the API.
There is no change in this release from v0.11.1. This release has been a long
time coming!

The kmsg package is a separate dedicated module and its API can still change if
Kafka changes the protocol in a way that breaks kmsg. However, the odds are
increasingly likely that kmsg will switch to bumping major versions as Kafka
makes incompatible changes, so that the module does not have breaking updates.

v0.11.1
===

This is a patch release to a bug introduced in v0.10.3 / v0.11.0.

The intent is to tag v1.0 either Friday (tomorrow) or Monday.

- [`1469495`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/1469495) **bugfix** isRetriableBrokerErr: nil error is **not** retriable (thanks [@Neal](https://github.com/Neal)!)

- [`3684df2`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/3684df2) fetches: rename CollectRecords to Records

v0.11.0
===

This release is an rc2 for a v1 release, and contains breaking API changes
related to renaming some options. The point of this release is to allow any
chance for final API suggestions before stabilization.

The following configuration options were changed:

* `ConnTimeoutOverhead` to `RequestTimeoutOverhead`
* `CommitCallback` to `AutoCommitCallback`
* `On{Assigned,Revoked,Lost}` to `OnPartitions{Assigned,LostRevoked}`
* `BatchCompression` to `ProducerBatchCompression`
* `Linger` to `ProducerLinger`
* `BatchMaxBytes` to `ProducerBatchMaxBytes`
* `{,Stop}OnDataLoss` to `{,Stop}ProducerOnDataLossDetected`
* `RecordTimeout` to `RecordDeliveryTimeout`

The point of these renames is to make the options a bit clearer as to their
purpose and to hopefully be slightly less confusing.

**If you have any API suggestions that should be addressed before a 1.0 API
stabilization release, please open an issue.**

- [`577c73a`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/577c73a) **breaking**: rename RecordTimeout to RecordDeliveryTimeout

v0.10.3
===

This is a small release intended to be a minor release for anybody that does
not want to update the API. The next release, v0.11.0, is going to contain
breaking config option changes. The point of the intermediate release is to
allow a few days for anybody to raise issues for better suggestions.

- [`d5e80b3`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/d5e80b3) bump min go version to go1.15

v0.10.2
===

This release contains everything currently outstanding for a v1.0.0 release.
Primarily, this release addresses #57, meaning that by default, auto committing
no longer has the potential to lose records during crashes. It is now highly
recommended to have a manual `CommitUncommittedOffsets` before shutting down if
autocommitting, just to prevent any unnecessary duplicate messages.

The aim is to let this release bake for a day / a few days / a week so that if
anybody tries it out, I can receive any bug reports.

v0.10.1
===

This fix contains an important bugfix for some behavior introduced in v0.9.1,
as well as extra debug logging messages, and a few other general improvements.
Some more errors are now retriable in more cases, and the client can now
tolerate some input seeds being invalid when others are not invalid.

It is highly recommended that any use of v0.9.1 switch to v0.10.1. If on v0.9.1
and a produced batch has a retriable error, and then some cluster maintenance
causes the partition to move to a different broker, the client will be unable
to continue producing to the partition.

v0.10.0
===

#62 now tracks the v1.0.0 stabilization status. This release contains
everything but addressing #57, which I would like to address before
stabilizing.

After using this client some more in a different program, I've run into some
things that are better to break now. Particularly, a few options are awkward.
The goal is for this release to make these options less awkward.

Three options have been renamed in this release, the fixes are very simple (and
ideally, if you used `RetryTimeout`, you may find the new `RetryTimeout` even
simpler).

- [`8199f5b`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/8199f5b) **breaking**: split RetryTimeout function

v0.9.1
===

v0.9.0 is to be stabilized, but I would like to address #57 first, which may
slightly change how autocommitting works. This intermediate release pulls in
some decent fixes.

v0.9.0
===

This is a v1.0 release candidate. The only breaking change in this release is
that the kmsg package is now a dedicated module.

### Why have a module for kmsg?

The kmsg package is almost entirely autogenerated from the Kafka protocol.
Unfortunately, the Kafka protocol is mostly designed for an object oriented
language (i.e., Java), so some changes to the Kafka protocol that are
non-breaking are breaking in the kmsg package. In particular, the Kafka changes
a non-nullable field to a nullable field, the kmsg package must change from a
non-pointer to a pointer. This is a breaking change. Even more rarely,
sometimes Kafka changes a field's type by renaming its old version to
"SomethingOld" and having a new version take the place of "Something". I would
prefer the kmsg avoid "SomethingNew" to avoid deprecating the old field, so I
also choose to rename fields.

One option is to have absolutely everything be a pointer in the kmsg package,
but this would create a lot of garbage and make using the API even worse. As
well, I could just add newly named fields, but this makes things worse as time
goes on, because the newer fields would be the ones with the worse names.

In Go, if kmsg were stabilized, any protocol change would need to be a major
version bump. We cannot get away with minor bumps and a big doc comment saying
"deal with it", because we run into a transitive dependency issue: if user A
uses franz-go at v1.1.0, and they also use a library that uses franz-go at
v1.0.0, and there is an incompatible kmsg change, then the user's compilation
breaks.

So, we choose to have a dedicated module for kmsg which is unversioned. This
avoids some transitive dependency issues.

If you use the kmsg package directly, the only update you should need to do is:

```
go get -u github.com/twmb/franz-go/pkg/kmsg@latest
```

### Other potentially notable changes

- [`f82e5c6`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/f82e5c6) consumer: document that a nil / closed context is supported for polling
- [`8770662`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/8770662) very minor bugfix for producing: only opt in to more than 1req if idempotent
- [`5c0a2c7`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/5c0a2c7) bench: add -prometheus flag

v0.8.7
===

This release contains commits for upcoming Kafka protocol changes, new features
to gain insight into buffered records (and intercept & modify them before being
produced or consumed), a few minor other changes, and one minor breaking
change.

The minor breaking change should not affect anybody due to its rather niche use
when better methods exist, but if it does, the fix is to delete the
`Partitions` field that was removed (the field is now embedded).

This field was removed just for ease of use purposes: there was no reason to
have a separate named field in `FetchTopicPartition` for the `Partition`,
instead, we can just embed `FetchPartition` to make usage of the type much
simpler. Dropping this field basically makes this type much more appealing to
use.

I may be releasing v0.9.0 shortly, with plans to potentially split the kmsg
package into a dedicated module. More details on that if this happens.

### Breaking change

- [`ffc94ea`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/ffc94ea) **minor breaking change**: embed `FetchPartition` in `FetchTopicPartition` rather than have a named `Partition` field

This small tag fixes a bug in group consuming via regex, adds a new
`-static-record` flag to the benchmark example, and has a few other very minor
changes (see commits).

Also, thank you @Neal for fixing some typos and eliminating a useless goroutine
in the benchmarks!

v0.8.5
===

- [`2732fb8`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/2732fb8) **bugfix** consumer: bugfix consuming of specific partitions if no topics are specified

If `ConsumePartitions` was used without `ConsumeTopics`, the consumer would not
start. This was missed in the conversion of starting the consumer after
initializing a client to initializing the consumer _with_ the client.

v0.8.4
===

- [`e0346a2`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/e0346a2) **very minor bugfix** consumer group: set defaultCommitCallback
- [`5047b31`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/5047b31) and [`05a6b8a`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/05a6b8a) bench: add -linger, -disable-idempotency, -log-level, -compression, -batch-max-bytes options

This is a small release containing a very minor bugfix and more flags on the
benchmark program. The bugfix basically re-adds a missing commit callback if
you are not specifying your own, and the default commit callback just logs
errors. So in short, this release ensures you see errors if there are any and
you are using the default commit callback.

v0.8.3
===

- [`053911b`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/053911b) plugins: fix module declarations

This is a patch release on the prior commit to fix the path declarations in the
new plugin modules.

v0.8.2
===

- [`65a0ed1`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/65a0ed1) add pluggable kgmetrics, kprom, kzap packages & examples

This release immediately follows the prior release so that the plugin packages
can refer to v0.8.1, which contains the (hopefully) final API breakages. This
allows Go's version resolution to ensure users of these plugins use the latest
franz-go package.

These new plugins should make it very easy to integrate prometheus or
go-metrics or zap with kgo.

v0.8.1
===

This release contains a few features, one minor bugfix, two minor breaking
API changes, and a few minor behavior changes.

This release will immediately be followed with a v0.8.2 release that contains
new examples using our new hooks added in this release.

### Breakage

One of the breaking API changes is followup from the prior release: all
broker-specific hooks were meant to be renamed to `OnBrokerXyz`, but I missed
`OnThrottle`. This is a rather niche hook so ideally this does not break
many/any users.

The other breaking API change is to make an API consistent: we have `Produce`
and `ProduceSync`, and now we have `CommitRecords` and
`CommitUncommittedOffsets` in addition to the original `CommitOffsets`, so
`BlockingCommitOffsets` should be renamed to `CommitOffsetsSync`. This has the
added benefit that now all committing functions will be next to each other in
the documentation. One benefit with breaking this API is that it may help
notify users of the much more easily used `CommitUncommittedOffsets`.

### Features

- Two new partitioners have been added, one of which allows you to set the
  `Partition` field on a record before producing and have the client use that
field for partitioning.

- Two new hooks have been added that allow tracking some metrics per-batch
  while producing and consuming. More per-batch metrics can be added to the
hooks later if necessary, because the hooks take a struct that can be expanded
upon.

- The client now returns an injected `ErrClientClosed` fetch partition when
  polling if the client has been closed, and `Fetches` now contains a helper
`IsClientClosed` function. This can be used to break out of a poll loop on
shutdown.

### Behavior changes

- The client will no longer add empty fetches to be polled. If fetch sessions
  are disabled, or in certain other cases, Kafka replies to a fetch requests
with the requested topics and partitions, but no records. The client would
process these partitions and add them to be polled. Now, the client will avoid
adding empty fetches (unless they contain an error), meaning polling should
always have fetches that contain either records or an error.

- When using sharded requests, the client no longer issues split pieces of the
  requests to partitions that are currently erroring. Previously, if a request
needed to go to the partition leader, but the leader was offline, the client
would choose a random broker to send the request to. The request was expected
to fail, but the failure error would be retriable, at which point we would
reload metadata and hope the initial partition leader error would be resolved.
We now just avoid this try-and-fail-and-hope loop, instead erroring the split
piece immediately.

### Examples

This contains one more example, [`examples/group_consuming`](./examples/group_consuming),
which demonstrates how to consume as a group and commit in three different ways,
and describes the downsides of autocommitting.

v0.8.0
===

This is a **major breaking release**. This release is intended to be a release
candidate for a v1.0.0 tag; thus, I wanted to nail down all API breakage now to
help prevent future breakage and to ensure a path towards 1.0 stabilization. I
do not expect major API changes after this tag, and I intend to release v1.0.0
within a month of this tag.

## Why the breakage?

It never felt "right" that to consume, you needed to first create a client, and
then assign something to consume. One large reason that `AssignXyz` existed was
so that you could reassign what was being consumed at runtime. In fact, you
could consume from a group, then leave and switch to direct partition
consuming, and then switch back to consuming from a different group. This
flexibility was unnecessary, and assigning after the client was initialized was
awkward. Worse, allowing these reassignments necessitated extreme care to not
have race conditions or deadlocks. This was the source of many bugs in the
past, and while they have since been ironed out, we may as well just remove
them as a possibility while on the path towards v1.0.

Because we have this one major breakage already, I decided it was a good time
to clean up the other not-so-great aspects of the code.

- All current hooks have been renamed, because `OnE2E` being dedicated to
  brokers does not leave room for a different `E2E` hook in the future that is
not specific to brokers. Instead, if we namespace the current broker hooks, we
can namespace future hooks as well, and nothing will look weird. More
beneficially, in user code, the hook will be more self describing.

- One now redundant option has been removed (`BrokerConnDeadRetries`), and one
  useless option has been removed (`DisableClientID`).

Moving consumer options to the client required changing the names of some
consumer options, merging some duplicated group / direct options, adding
`*Client` as an argument to some callbacks, and cleaning up some consume APIs.

From there on, the breakages get more minor: `AutoTopicCreation` now is
`AllowAutoTopicCreation`, and `ProduceTopic` is now `DefaultProduceTopic`.

## Upgrade considerations

Due to the number of breaking changes, upgrading may _look_ more difficult than
it actually is. I've updated every example in this repo and all code usage
in my corresponding [`kcl`](github.com/twmb/kcl) repo, these updates were
completed relatively quickly.

## tl;dr of upgrading

The simpler fixes:

- Change `AutoTopicCreate` to `AllowAutoTopicCreate`
- Change `ProduceTopic` to `DefaultProduceTopic`
- Remove `BrokerConnDeadRetries` and `DisableClientID` if you used them (unlikely)
- Add `Broker` in any hook (`OnConnect` => `OnBrokerConnect`, etc)

If directly consuming, perform the following changes to options and move the options to `NewClient`:

- Drop the offset argument from `ConsumeTopics`
- Move `ConsumePartitions`
- Change `ConsumeTopicsRegex` to `ConsumeRegex`
- Delete `AssignPartitions`

If group consuming, perform the following changes to options and move the options to `NewClient`:

- Add `ConsumerGroup` with the group argument you used in `AssignGroup`
- Change `GroupTopics` to `ConsumeTopics`
- Add a `*Client` argument to any of `OnAssigned`, `OnRevoked`, `OnLost`, and `CommitCallback`

If using a group transaction session, perform the above group changes, and use `NewGroupTransactSession`, rather than `NewClient`.

v0.7.9
===

- [`5231902`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/5231902) **bugfix** patch on prior commit

If I could yank tags, I would.

v0.7.8
===

- [`b7cb533`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/b7cb533) **bugfix** allow any `*os.SyscallError` to be retriable

_This_ should be the last v0.7 release. This is a small bugfix to allow much
more retrying of failing requests, particularly around failed dials, which is
much more resilient to restarting brokers.

v0.7.7
===

- [`afa1209`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/afa1209) txn: detect a fatal txnal client when beginning transactions
- [`5576dce`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/5576dce) benchmarks: add comparisons to confluent-kafka-go & sarama
- [`d848174`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/d848174) examples: add benchmarking example
- [`fec2a18`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/fec2a18) client: fix request buffer pool, add promisedNumberedRecord pool
- [`a0d712e`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/a0d712e) transactions: small wording changes in docs
- [`bad47ba`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/bad47ba) and [`a9691bd`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/a9691bd) **feature** hooks: add HookBrokerE2E

This is a small release with one useful new hook, a few minor updates /
internal fixes, and no bug fixes.

This now properly pools request buffers, which will reduce garbage when
producing, and re-adds pooling slices that records are appended to before
flushing. This latter pool is less important, but can help.

This now adds one more chance to recover a transactional client, which also
gives the user a chance to things are fatally failed when beginning
transactions.

Finally, this adds a benchmarking example and comparisons to sarama /
confluent-kafka-go. To say the least, the numbers are favorable.

This is likely the last release of the v0.7 series, the next change will be a
few breaking API changes that should hopefully simplify initializing a
consumer.

v0.7.6
===

This is a small release that adds defaults for any `kmsg.Request` that has a
`TimeoutMillis` field that previously did not have a default.

This also changes how the `TimeoutMillis` field is specified for generating,
and now all documentation around it is consistent.

Lastly, any field that has a default now has that default documented.

v0.7.5
===

This commit adds support for session tokens and user agents in `AWS_MSK_IAM`,
as well as adds an [example](./examples/sasl/aws_msk_iam) for how to use
`AWS_MSK_IAM`.

v0.7.4
===

- [`467e739`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/467e739) FirstErrPromise: change semantics

This is a small release to change the semantics of `FirstErrPromise`: now, it
uses a `sync.WaitGroup` on every `Promise` and will wait until all records have
been published / aborted before returning from `Err`. This also adds an
`AbortingFirstErrPromise` that automatically aborts all records if any promise
finishes with an error.

v0.7.3
===

- [`30c4ba3`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/30c4ba3) **feature** sasl: add support for `AWS_MSK_IAM`

This is a small release dedicated to adding support for `AWS_MSK_IAM` sasl.

v0.7.2
===

- [`522c9e2`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/522c9e2) **bugfix** consumer group: use `JoinGroupResponse.Protocol`, not `SyncGroupResponse.Protocol`

This is a small bugfix release; the `Protocol` field in `SyncGroupResponse` was
added in 2.5.0, and my integration tests did not catch this because I usually
test against the latest releases. All `JoinGroupResponse` versions have the
protocol that was chosen, so we use that field.

v0.7.1
===

- [`98f74d1`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/98f74d1) README: note that we actually do support KIP-533
- [`528f007`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/528f007) and [`ef9a16a`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/ef9a16a) and [`d0cc729`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/d0cc729) **bugfix** client: avoid caching invalid coordinators; allow retries

This is a small bugfix release: previously, if FindCoordinator returned a node
ID of -1, we would permanently cache that. -1 is returned when the load has an
error, which we were not checking, but even still, we should not cache the
response if we do not know of the broker.

Now, we will only cache successful loads.

(Also, I noticed that I _do_ have an existing configuration knob for the retry
timeout, so that is now "Supported" in the KIP section, making all KIPs
supported).

v0.7.0
===

This is a big release, and it warrants finally switching to 0.7.0. There are a
few small breaking changes in this release, a lot of new features, a good few
bug fixes, and some other general changes. The documentation has been
overhauled, and there now exists an example of hooking in to prometheus metrics
as well as an example for EOS.

Most of the new features are quality of life improvements; I recommend taking a
look at them to see where they might simplify your code.

## Upgrade considerations

Besides the two breaking changes just below, one bug fix may affect how you if
you are using a group consumer with autocommitting. If autocommitting, the
consumer should always have been issuing a blocking commit when leaving the
group to commit the final consumed records. A bug existed such that this commit
would never actually be issued. That bug has been fixed, so now, if you rely on
autocommitting, the client closing may take a bit longer due to the blocking
commit.

## Breaking changes

There are two breaking changes in this release, one of which likely will go
unnoticed. First, to allow all hooks to display next to each other in godoc,
the interfaces have had their trailing "Hook" moved to a leading "Hook".
Second and definitely noticeable, record producing no longer returns an error.
The original error return was not really that intuitive and could lead to bugs
if not understood entirely, so it is much simpler to just always call the
promise.

- [`215f76f`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/215f76f) small breaking API: prefix hook interfaces with "Hook"
- [`c045366`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/c045366) producer: drop error return from Produce (breaking API change)

v0.6.14
===

- [`dc44d10`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/dc44d10) sink: call producerID after creating the produce request
- [`ce113d5`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/ce113d5) **bugfix** producer: fix potential lingering recBuf issue
- [`19d57dc`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/19d57dc) **bugfix** metadata: do not nil cursors/records pointers ever
- [`e324b56`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/e324b56) producing: evaluate whether a batch should fail before and after

This is a small bugfix release for v0.6.13, which would panic if a user was
producing to and consuming from the same topic within a single client.

At the same time, there was a highly-unlikely-to-be-experienced bug where
orphaned recBuf pointers could linger in a sink through a certain sequence
of events (see the producer bugfix commit for more details).

This also now avoids initializing a producer ID when consuming only. For code
terseness during the producer redux, I moved the createReq portion in sink to
below the producerID call. We actually call createReq when there are no records
ever produced: a metadata update adding a recBuf to a sink triggers a drain,
which then evaluates the recBuf and sees there is nothing to produce. This
triggered drain was initializing a producer ID unnecessesarily. We now create
the request and see if there is anything to flush before initializing the
producer ID, and we now document the reason for having producerID after
createReq so that I do not switch the order in the future again.

Lastly, as a feature enhancement, this unifies the logic that fails buffered
records before producing or after producing. The context can now be used to
cancel records after producing, and record timeouts / retries can be evaluated
before producing. The order of evaluation is first the context, then the record
timeout, and lastly the number of tries.

- [`0554ad5`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/0554ad5): producer: retry logic changes

This release focuses on restructing some code to allow deleting topics from the
client and, most importantly, to allow records to fail even with idempotency.

For deleting records, this is a minimal gain that will really only benefit a
user reassigning consuming topics, or for producers to a topic that does not
exist. Still, nifty, and for an EOS user, produce and consume topics will no
longer be next to each other (which may make scanning partitions to produce or
consume quicker).

For allowing records to have limited retries / be canceled with a context, this
is an important feature that gives users more control of aborting the work they
tried. As noted in the config docs, we cannot always safely abort records, but
for the most part, we can. The only real unsafe time is when we have written a
produce request but have not received a response. If we ever get a response for
the first batch in a record buffer (or if we do not write the batch ever), then
we can safely fail the records. We do not need to worry about the other
concurrent requests because if the first batch errors, the others will error
and we know we can fail records based off the first's status, and if the first
batch does not error, we will just finish the records (and not error them).

v0.6.12
===

This is a small release corresponding with Kafka's 2.8.0 release.
A few small things were fixed when trying out `kcl misc probe-versions`
with the new code, and with that, we are able to determine exactly
where to cut 2.8.0 from tip in the kversion package.

Lastly, this also converts topic IDs that are introduced in this release
from `[2]uint64` to `[16]byte`. A raw blob of bytes is easier to reason
about and affords us avoiding worrying about endianness.

This is an important release with multiple bug fixes. All important commits
are noted above; less important ones are elided.

The producer code has been overhauled to more accurately manage sequence
numbers. Particularly, we cannot just reset sequence numbers whenever. A
sequence number reset is a really big deal, and so we should avoid it at all
costs unless absolutely necessary.

By more accurately tracking sequence numbers, we are able to abort buffered
records when aborting a transact session. The simple approach we take here is
to reset the producer ID after the abort is completed.

The most major consumer bug was one that incorrectly tracked uncommitted
offsets when multiple topics were consumed in a single group member. The other
bugs would be infrequently hit through some more niche edge cases / timing
issues.

The lz4 module was updated, which will require a go mod edit. This was done
because major-version-bumping is pretty undiscoverable with mod updates, and it
turns out I had always used v1 instead of v4.

Sometime in the past, a broker/producer bugfix accidentally lost the ability to
send 5 concurrent produce request at once. That ability is readded in this
release, but this can occasionally trigger a subtle problem within Kafka while
transactionally producing. For more details, see [KAFKA-12671](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12671).
The client attempts to work around this problem by sleeping for 1s if it detects
the problem has a potential of happening when aborting buffered records. Realistically,
this problem should not happen, but the one way to easily detect it is to look
for a stuck LastStableOffset.

A `ConnIdleTimeout` option was added that allows for reaping idle connections.
The logic takes a relatively easy approach, meaning idle connections may take
up to 2x the idle timeout to be noticed, but that should not be problematic.
This will help prevent the problem of Kafka closing connections and the client
only noticing when it goes to eventually write on the connection again. This
will also help avoid sockets in the kernel being stuck in `CLOSE_WAIT`.

Finally, after being inspired from [KAFKA-12675](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12671),
I have significantly optimized the sticky assignor, as well as added other
improvements for the cooperative adjusting of group balancer plans.

This is an important release that fixes various bugs in the consumer code and
adds a few nice-to-have features. Particularly, this includes a minor redux of
the consumer group code that audited for correctness, and includes a few
transactional consumer fixes.

There is a known problem in sequence numbers in the producer code that will be
hit if any consumer resets its sequence numbers. This happens if a consumer
hits a produce timeout or hits the retry limit, and may happen if
`AbortBufferedRecords` is called. A fix for this is being worked on now and
will be in the next release.

Most commits since v0.6.9 are noted above, minus a few that are left out for
being very minor documentation updates or something similar.

v0.6.9
===

- [`0ca274c`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/0ca274c): **bugfix** consumer group: fix race where we did not wait for a revoke to finish if the group closed
- [`0cdc2b6`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/0cdc2b6): **bugfix** consumer: process FetchResponse's RecordBatches correctly (versions after v0.11.0 can use message sets)
- [`bcb330b`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/bcb330b): kerr: add TypedErrorForCode and four new errors
- [`31a9bbc`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/31a9bbc): **bugfix** (that is not hit by general consumers): FetchResponse's DivergingEpoch.EndOffset is an int64, not int32

This release fixes some problems with consuming. As it turns out, message sets,
which are unused after v0.11.0, are indeed returned with higher FetchResponse
versions. Thus, we cannot rely on the FetchResponse version alone to decide
whether to decode as a message set or a record batch, instead we must check the
magic field.

The `DivergingEpoch.EndOffset` bug likely would not be noticed by general
consumers, as this is a field set by leaders to followers and is not useful to
nor set for clients. As well, it's only used for the not-yet-finalized raft work.

I noticed a race while looping through integration tests in `-race` mode, this
was an easy fix. Practically, the race can only be encountered when leaving a
group if your revoke is slow and the timing races exactly with the manage loop
also revoking. This would mean your onRevoke could be called twice. Now, that
will not happen. This bug itself is basically a reminder to go through and
audit the consumer group code, one of the last chunks of code I intend to
potentially redux internally.

v0.6.8
===

- [`8a42602`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/8a42602): **bugfix** kversion: avoid panic on a key with value of max int16 (32767)

This is a small bugfix release; Confluent replies with odd keys sometimes,
turns out this time it was max int16. That showed that the parentheses was in
the wrong place for SetMaxKeyVersions.

This also has one more commit that change the String output a little bit to use
"Unknown" instead of an empty string on unknown keys.

v0.6.7
===

- [`2bea568`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/2bea568): **bugfix** producer: fix producing with NoAck
- [`d1ecc7b`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/d1ecc7b): On invalidly broker large reads, guess if the problem is a tls alert on a plaintext connection

This is a small bugfix release to fix producing with no acks. As it turns out,
Kafka truly sends _no_ response when producing with no acks. Previously, we
would produce, then hang until the read timeout, and then think the entire
request failed. We would retry in perpetuity until the request retry limit hit,
and then we would fail all records in a batch.

This fixes that by immediately finishing all promises for produce requests if
we wrote successfully.

v0.6.6
===

- [`21ddc56`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/21ddc56): kgo: sort `RequestSharded` by broker metadata before returning
- [`4979b52`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/4979b52): **bugfix** consumer: ensure we advance when consuming compacted topics

This is a small bugfix release to fix a stuck-consumer bug on compacted topics.

v0.6.5
===

- [`d5b9365`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/d5b9365): configuration: clamp max partition bytes to max bytes to work around faulty providers
- [`c7dbafb`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/c7dbafb): **bugfix** consumer: kill the session if the response is less than version 7
- [`f57fc76`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/f57fc76): **bugfix** producer: handle ErrBrokerTooOld in doInitProducerID, allowing the producer to work for 0.10.0 through 0.11.0

This is a small release to ensure that we can make progress when producing to
Kafka clusters v0.10.0 through v0.11.0 (as well as that we can consume from
them if the consume has a partition error).

v0.6.4
===

- [`802bf74`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/802bf74): **bugfix** kgo: fix three races
- [`1e5c11d`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/1e5c11d): kgo: Favor non-seeds when selecting brokers for requests that go to a random broker

- [`fe7d976`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/fe7d976): KIP-500 / KIP-631: add support for admin-level request DecommissionBroker
- [`ab66776`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/ab66776): KIP-500 / KIP-631: add support for broker-only requests BrokerRegistration and BrokerHeartbeat
- [`31b1df7`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/31b1df7): KIP-664: add support for DescribeProducers
- [`368bb21`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/368bb21): **breaking kmsg protocol changes**: add support for KIP-516 CreateTopics and DeleteTopics bumps
- [`b50282e`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/b50282e): kerr: ReplicaNotAvailable is retriable; add UnknownTopicID
- [`c05572d`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/c05572d): kmsg: change (Request|Response)ForKey to use proper NewPtr functions
- [`360a4dc`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/360a4dc): client: actually use ConnTimeoutOverhead properly; bump base to 20s
- [`0ff08da`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/0ff08da): Allow list offsets v0 to work (for Kafka v0.10.0 and before)
- [`59c935c` through `c7caea1`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/compare/59c935c..c7caea1): fix fetch session bugs
- [pr #4](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/pull/4): Redesign readme (thanks [@weeco](https://github.com/weeco)!)

Of note, this fixes three races, fixes fetch session bugs and has small
breaking protocol changes in kmsg.

For the three races, two of them are obvious in hindsight, but one makes no
sense and may not belong in franz-go itself. The fix for the third is to remove
a line that we do not need to do anyway.

For fetch sessions, sessions were not reset properly in the face of context
cancelations or across consumer topic reassignments. It was possible for fetch
sessions to get out of sync and never recover. This is fixed by resetting fetch
sessions in all appropriate places.

For kmsg protocol changes, DeleteTopics changed Topics from a list of strings
(topics to delete) to a list of structs where you could delete by topic or by
topic uuid. The Java code coincidentally historically used TopicNames, so it
did not need to break the protocol to add this new struct under the Topics
name. For lack of confusion, we change Topics to TopicNames and introduce the
struct under Topics.

v0.6.3
===

- [`db09137`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/db09137): Add support for new DescribeCluster API (KIP-700); followup commit (`ab5bdd3`) deprecates `Include<*>AuthorizedOperations` in the metadata request.
- [`3866e0c`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/3866e0c): Set Record.Attrs properly before calling Produce callback hook.
- [`05346db`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/05346db) and [`3d3787e`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/3d3787e): kgo: breaking change for kversions breaking change two commits ago (see two lines below)
- [`b921c14`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/b921c14): doc fix: v0.10.0 changed produce from MessageSet v0 to MessageSet v1
- [`33a8b26`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/33a8b26): Breaking pointerification change to kversions.Versions; introduce VersionGuess

Two small breaking changes related to kversions.Versions in this; switching to
pointers now makes the struct future compatible; if it grows, we avoid the
concern of passing around a large struct on the stack.

Contains one small fix related to KIP-360 w.r.t. the idempotent producer: when
we encounter OutOfOrderSequenceNumber, we need to reset _all_ partition's
sequence numbers, not just the failing one. This is now done by resetting
everything the next time the producer ID is loaded. The related Kafka ticket is
KAFKA-12152.

The primary commit of this release is `539b06c`, which completely rewrites the
consumer.go and source.go files to be more easily understandable. This commit
also fixes a bug related to the `sink` and `source` broker pointers; if the
broker changed but kept the same node ID, the `sink` and `source` would not
have their old pointers (to the old broker) updated.

There were some small breaking API changes in the `kmsg` package, most notably,
the metadata request changed one field from a `string` to a `*string` due to
Kafka switching the field from non-nullable to nullable. As specified in the
`kmsg` docs, API compatibility is not guaranteed due to Kafka being able to
switch things like this (and I favor small breakages like this rather than
wrapping every type into a struct with a `null` field).

The `kversion` package has had its `Versions` type completely changed. The new
format should be future compatible for new changes. The current change was
required due to Kafka's `ApiVersions` having a gap in keys that it responds
with in 2.7.0.

Config validation has been strengthened quite a bit.

Includes a few other minor, not too noteworthy changes.

v0.6.1
===

- [`0ddc468b2`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/0ddc468b2ceca4fc0e42206c397f6d7ccd74bc4b): Workaround for two minor EventHubs issues.

This is a small release to patch around two minor EventHubs protocol serializing issues.

v0.6.0
===

- [`0024a93a4`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/0024a93a4d386318869fe029260f3e23a602c03e): Fix bug introduced in pkg/kgo/source.go

- [`6e0b042e3`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/commit/6e0b042e3ad2281b82030375257f0c200bc511c3): Pin the client by default to the latest stable API versions

This release also changes the name to franz-go. After sitting on frang for a
week, ultimately I was missing the fact that the name related to Kafka. `franz`
is an easy enough mental map, and then this brings back the `-go` suffix.

v0.5.0

Multiple generator changes were made to better handle tags, add support for

made in kgo to use the new `RequestWith` function. More debug & warn log lines
were added around opening a connection and initializing sasl.

This release also changed the name of the repo from "kafka-go" to "frang" to
avoid potential trademark issues down the road.
